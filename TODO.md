- IMPROVE LAYOUT (palette, cooldown, etc...)
- Implement connected count
- Allow admin to change cooldown without having to redeploy
- Implement initial popup (one time popup) with rules + accept button like "I swear i won't draw swastikas and dicks" and decline button like "I can't control myself" that will redirect the user somewhere funny
